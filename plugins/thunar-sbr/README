Thunar Simple Builtin Renamers (thunar-sbr)
===========================================

Thunar-sbr is an extension to Thunar, which includes a bunch of simple renamers
for the bulk rename dialog: 

 * Insert / Overwrite
 * Insert Date / Time
 * Numbering
 * Remove Characters
 * Search & Replace
 * Uppercase / Lowercase

By default the thunar-sbr extension will be installed, but as with every
extension, it will slightly increase the resource usage of Thunar (this
shouldn't be a real problem unless you're targeting an embedded system), and so
you can pass `--disable-sbr-plugin' to configure and the plugin won't be built
and installed. Since it is an extension, you can also easily uninstall it
afterwards by removing the thunar-sbr.so file from the lib/thunarx-2/ directory
of your installation (be sure to quit Thunar before removing files though).


Regular Expressions
-------------------

The "Search & Replace" renamer can be built with support for regular ex-
pressions using the Perl-compatible regular expression (PCRE) library
version 6.0 or above. The reasons to use PCRE instead of the POSIX regular
expressions, that are part of the system C library, are:

 * PCRE supports UTF-8, which Thunar uses internally for all user visible
   texts (be sure to enable this when installing PCRE using the --enable-utf8
   configure switch).
 * PCRE uses a more consistent syntax, which is easier to understand for
   most people.
