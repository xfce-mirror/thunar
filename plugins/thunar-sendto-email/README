Thunar Sendto Email (thunar-sendto-email)
=========================================

Thunar-sendto-email is an extension to Thunar, which adds an additional entry
to the "Send To" sub menu, named "Mail Recipient", that starts the mail composer
and attaches the selected files (using the exo-open mechanism).

The extension uses the zip command to compress folders prior to sending them
to the mail client, since most mail clients cannot handle directories as at-
tachments. For regular files, larger than 200KiB, the extension prompts the
user whether to compress the files (using the zip command) prior to sending
them to the mail client.
