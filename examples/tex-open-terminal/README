This is an example for a Thunar Extension that provides additional context
menu items. It adds an "Open Terminal Here" action to the folder context
menu and to the file context menu of directories, and thereby allows you
to open a new Terminal instance in the given folder.

The example is mainly provided for developers to get an idea about how
to write an extension that implements the ThunarxMenuProvider interface.

The extension is not installed by default, as every installed extension
increases the resources required to run Thunar. If you want to install
this extension, you can use the command

  make install-extensionsLTLIBRARIES

in this directory.

Please note that this extension is not meant for daily use, but should just
serve as an example of how to write a simple Thunar extension. If you want
to be able to open a terminal in a specific folder, you should consider
installing the thunar-uca extension (see thunar-uca/README) and adding an
"Open Terminal Here" action there (there's already such an action available
by default).
