 * Checks that the <systemitem class="library">thunarx</systemitem> library
 * in use is compatible with the given version. Generally you would pass in
 * the constants #THUNARX_MAJOR_VERSION, #THUNARX_MINOR_VERSION and

 * compiled against.
 *
 * This function should be called by extensions in the
 * thunar_extension_initialize() method to verify that the <systemitem
 * class="library">thunarx</systemitem> library used by file manager is
 * compatible with the version the extension was compiled with.
