/**
 * thunarx_property_page_provider_get_pages:
 * @provider : a #ThunarxPropertyPageProvider.
 * @files    : the list of #ThunarxFileInfo<!---->s for which a properties dialog will be displayed.
 *
 * Returns the list of #ThunarxPropertyPage<!---->s that @provider has to offer for @files.
 *
 * Extensions that implement this interface, must first check whether they support all the
 * #ThunarxFileInfo<!---->s in the list of @files. Most extensions will probably only support
 * #ThunarxPropertyPage<!---->s for exactly one file of a certain type. For example an MP3-Tag
 * editor property page will most probably support only a single audio file, and so the method
 * would be implemented like this
 * <informalexample><programlisting>
 * GList*
 * tag_provider_get_pages (ThunarxPropertyPageProvider *property_page_provider,
 *                         GList                       *files)
 * {
 *   if (g_list_length (files) != 1)
 *     return NULL;
 *   else if (!thunarx_file_info_has_mime_type (files->data, "audio/mp3"))
 *     return NULL;
 *   else
 *     return g_list_append (NULL, tag_page_new (files->data));
 * }
 * </programlisting></informalexample>
 * where tag_page_new() allocates a new #TagPage instance for a #ThunarxFileInfo object
 * passed to it. See the description of the #ThunarxPropertyPage class for additional
 * information about the #TagPage example class.
 *
 * As a special note, this method automatically takes a reference on the
 * @provider for every #ThunarxPropertyPage object returned from the real implementation
 * of this method in @provider. This is to make sure that the extension stays
 * in memory for atleast the time that the pages are used. If the extension
 * wants to stay in memory for a longer time, it'll need to take care of this
 * itself (e.g. by taking an additional reference on the @provider itself,
 * that's released at a later time).
 *
 * The caller is responsible to free the returned list of pages using
 * something like this when no longer needed:
 * <informalexample><programlisting>
 * g_list_foreach (list, (GFunc) g_object_ref_sink, NULL);
 * g_list_free_full (list, g_object_unref);
 * </programlisting></informalexample>
 *
 * Return value: the list of #ThunarxPropertyPage<!---->s that @provider has to offer
 *               for @files.
