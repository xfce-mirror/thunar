/**
 * thunarx_renamer_provider_get_renamers:
 * @provider : a #ThunarxRenamerProvider.
 *
 * Returns the list of #ThunarxRenamer<!---->s provided by the
 * specified @provider.
 *
 * The real implementation of this method MUST return the #ThunarxRenamer<!---->s
 * with floating references (the default for g_object_new() on #GtkWidget
 * derived types).
 *
 * The returned #ThunarxRenamer<!---->s will be reffed and sinked automatically
 * by this function.
 *
 * As a special note, this method automatically takes a reference on the
 * @provider for every #ThunarxRenamer returned from the real implementation
 * of this method in @provider. This is to make sure that the extension stays
 * in memory for atleast the time that the renamers are used. If the extension
 * wants to stay in memory for a longer time, it'll need to take care of this
 * itself (e.g. by taking an additional reference on the @provider itself,
 * that's released at a later time).
 *
 * The caller is responsible to free the returned list of renamers using
 * something like this when no longer needed:
 * <informalexample><programlisting>
 * g_list_free_full (list, g_object_unref);
 * </programlisting></informalexample>
 *
 * Return value: the list of #ThunarxRenamer<!---->s provided by the
 *               specified @provider.
