## Backtrace
<!--
For crashes, it's best to get a backtrace to see which method failed to execute.

To get a meaningful backtrace, you will need to install debug symbols. Check the Xfce wiki to see how to do so:
https://docs.xfce.org/contribute/bugs/start#backtraces

It's basically `ulimit -c unlimited` to produce coredumps on crashes and then using gdb on it to get the backtrace out of the coredump.
